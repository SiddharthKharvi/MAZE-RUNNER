# MAZE-RUNNER
A simple maze solver robot, which helped me win two maze solver events

It uses very simple circuit schematic and very simple algorithm
make sure u calibrate for minimum detection distance based on maze

Steps:<br>
1> Assemble the Chassis<br>
2> Mount the Motors<br>
3> Mount compoents on Chassis with a gluegun or gum tape<br>
4> Mount servo on Chassis front, attach senor facing front on BOT.<br>
<!> Make sure servo is at 90Degree on mounting Sensor.<br>
5> connect the wirings as schematics<br>
6> Uplaod the Program<br>
7> check the functioning<br>
8> tune it according to Turn and Trigger distance<br>
7> attach the whells and All Set.!<br>

Schematics:

Turning delay is propotional to angle the bot turns,
Minmum distance will determine at what distance Bot sould STOP

the Program is Right Priority Algorithm: it scans right side of bot first

If Bot is not working check the Connections again, this worked for me perfectly ;)

WARNING:
DO NOT short-circuit Arduino / Battery<br>
DO NOT Supply Reverse Polarity<br>
USE voltage < 24 for Motor Driver<br>
USE voltage <=5 for Arduino (NOT via DC JACK)<br>

Thank You for Rading, Best of Luck

Open for any suggestion, correction.<br>
