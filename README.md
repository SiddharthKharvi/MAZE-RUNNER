# MAZE-RUNNER
A simple maze solver robot, which helped me win two maze solver events

It uses very simple circuit schematic and very simple algorithm
make sure u calibrate for minimum detection distance based on maze

Steps:
1> Assemble the Chassis

2> Mount the Motors

3> Mount compoents on Chassis with a gluegun or gum tape

4> Mount servo on Chassis front, attach senor facing front on BOT.

<!> Make sure servo is at 90Degree on mounting Sensor.

5> connect the wirings as schematics

6> Uplaod the Program

7> check the functioning

8> tune it according to Turn and Trigger distance

7> attach the whells and All Set.!

Turning delay is propotional to angle the bot turns
Minmum distance will determine at what distance Bot sould STOP

the Program is Right Priority Algorithm: it scans right side of bot first

If Bot is not working check the Connections again, this worked for me perfectly ;)

Thank You for Rading, Best of Luck

Open for any suggestion, correction.
