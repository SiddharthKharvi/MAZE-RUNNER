# MAZE-RUNNER
A simple maze solver robot, which helped me win two maze solver events

It uses very simple circuit schematic and very simple algorithm
make sure u calibrate for minimum detection distance based on maze

Turning delay is propotional to angle the bot turns
Minmum distance will determine at what distance Bot sould STOP

the Program is Right Priority Algorithm: it scans right side of bot first
